A small collection of bioinformatic scripts - Python based.

This is **not** a high-duty, high-performance library but a set of functions for exploring and developing phylogenetic ideas. The code can be useful for generating simulated data or performing off-line analysis.

Some parts are specific to `*`BEAST and BEAST.

See the [Utilities](Utilities.md) page for some scripts which may be useful and in addition illustrate how to use the library code.

biopy requires Python 2.7. For full functionality you need to install the following packages: numpy, scipy, lxml, matplotlib and biopython.

If you use biopy in a publication, please cite it (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.761224).
